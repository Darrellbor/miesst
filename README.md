# miesst
An application built for the purpose of tackling the educational issues.

The first build of the application would tackle the issue by providing value adding solutions under the following:
<ul>
<li>Todo list</li>
<li>Accounting function</li>
<li>Chat function</li>
<li>Birthday function</li>
<li>News function</li>
<li>Timetable function</li>
<li>Reading function</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Todo list:</b>
The todo list section would have date and time parameters which are optional but if activated, would send an email when a todo is due to be achieved, a day before the day.<br>

<b>Accounting function:</b>
The accounting section would be built to enable users keep track of their day to day expenditures as well as save a certain percent of their income always, in addition we would also create a section for users who prefer to make budgets rather than record day to day expenditures. we would create analysis and metrics functions, an advanced section of the accounting section would be created for users who own and manage businesses to be able to manage their accounts for a fee ofcouse.<br>

<b>Chat function:</b>
We all desire to communicate with people so why not create a platform to do just that with some perks. The chat function would enable users to chat with users which would be categoried according to course, program, department, college, level and finally univeersity since we're creating this across covenant and landmark university.<br>

<b>birthday function:</b>
Birthday's are special events and should be treated as such, so a function to wish the user a happy birthday as well as remind friends of the users birthday as well as informing friends of what this user might want based on the users wishlist and so on.<br>

<b>News function:</b>
We know that in covenant and landmark university it is quite hard to get up to date news of what is happening out of school sometimes even what is going on within the school, we would solve this problem by including news api's and for local happenings we would crowd source.<br>

<b>Reading function:</b>
This section of the app would allow users to create a list of all their courses and within each course a list of all the topics, what the app would do here is to create parameters for effective study for example studing a course like MAT321 you could have parameters like "main ideas of the topic", "Concept", "formulas", "examples", "application of the topic", "additional notes" and so on. To spice things up the user can specify the parameter based on the course or parameters in general to all courses. A section for your scores would be available to help the timetable function to creating your reading timetable.<br>

<b>Timetable function:</b>
Enable users to keep record of their class and exam timetable, the class timetable would help the app to create a reading timetable based on the courses you are weaker in or much attention has not been paid to.<br>

<b>This marks the very beginning of the miesst app.<br> <div align="right">1st August 2017.</div></b>
